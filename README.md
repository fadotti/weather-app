# weather-app

---

Sent in as a submission for [Project: Weather App](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app).

---

The goal of this project was to connect to an API, gather real world data, and to create an app around it. Skills that were used while working on this app are:

- Asynchronous programming and working with promises.
- Working with APIs and reading their documentation / implementation.

The API used to gather weather data is [visualcrossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/).

The background was designed by Steve Schoger of [heropatterns](https://heropatterns.com/).
